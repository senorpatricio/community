# community
An app for the Slenderiiz Community, replacing a previous Slenderiiz Community app no longer used.

###This assumes you have PIP and Virtualenv installed on your machine.

##To try this app out:
Clone or download the repository to a new directory. 
CD into the project.
Create a new virtual environment (`virtualenv`) in the project directory.

Enter your virtual environment.

In the project run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the project's dependancies.

Once installed, run `python manage.py runserver` to get your development server running.

You will receive instructions in the terminal as to where you can point your browser to see the project.
